# Data-Science-Projects
Hello there! 

Thank you for taking the time to look at my various Data Science projects!

I take great pride in my work and I hope you will notice the care and effort I put into each project.

## Projects

### Analysis of Movie Data 
What makes a movie a hit? This analysis looks at movie data to discover the common traits of movies that make over 100 million dollars at the box office.

### Analysis of Health and Fitness Data
Obesity has become an American epidemic and this analysis is an attempt to discover its root causes.

### Supervised Learning Analysis of Speed Dating Data:
How can you attract the perfect mate? This analysis using Supervised Learning techniques attempts to answer that question... and it's not necessarly what you'd expect.

### Natural Language Processing of Poetry
Can NLP distinguish the works of the world's most famous writers? Maybe... I'll be honest with you. This project, due to a few limitations with my self generated data set, is still a work in progress. But it does offer ideas on how to reach that solution.

### Myers-Briggs Personality Test
Using a mixture of Supervised and Unsupervised techniques, I was able to determine a person's Myers-Briggs personality type based off of their tweets on Twitter.
